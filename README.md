# Procedural Generation Framework
 A framework for procedural generation of tilemaps in Unity

NOTES
- For simulation of extra layers, generate (but do not assign, add to 2d array) in a while loop, return false bool if error occurs, while success == false, keep simulating, after only generate saved list of valid tiles at their coords
